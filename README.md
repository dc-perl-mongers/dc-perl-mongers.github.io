## Home

You're at the site for the Washington D.C. area Perl Mongers. We get together and talk about perl, teach one another new tricks of the trade and advocate the language wherever possible. Forays into other open-source software & hardware have been known to happen. Have ideas for the web site? Feel free to create a wiki page for your content. :)

### Meetings

Our meetings go down usually on the first Tuesday of every month from about 7pm-9pm in Washington, DC., unless otherwise noticed.

However, during the pandemic, we are meeting via video conference. You can join us:

- By clicking here: https://meet.jit.si/DCPerlMongers
- By going to that link, you can join the meeting. The open source jitsi software will attempt to use your web browser's media capabilities to connect video, audio, and chat to the meeting. Note, please MUTE yourself upon joining to reduce echo unless you are the presenter. There is an optional client you can download and install that allows for better integrations.
- You may connect to that link at any time, if you want to make sure that your system is ready to work with Jitsi. However, you won't really know how well it will work with your setup until there is somebody else at the other end. And we often hang out there to help people iron things out prior to the meeting.

When meetings don't happen on the first Tuesday of the month, we are notified on the mailing list, and this site and meetup.com is updated.

### Upcoming Presentations

All meetings are devoted to group discussion and helping each other. But it is nice to have a formal presentation or specific topic as well. Here is the queue of speakers who have proposed topics to be discussed at upcoming meetings.

- TBD

### Suggested Presentations/Topics

Throughout 2021, we're covering "all" the perl related web frameworks.

If you have an idea for a topic or would like to make a presentation, please send a note to the mailing list, or bring it up at a meeting ...

If there is time I will also touch on Test::Stream which is the next generation testing framework on the horizon for Perl.
